## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IgnacyBartnik/demo_image_classification.git
cd demo_image_classification

2. Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment (optional):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows

Install Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the Notebook

Open the notebook in Jupyter:

jupyter notebook Classifying_fruits.ipynb

Follow the cells to download the dataset, and then train and evaluate your model.
